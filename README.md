# ApexM800macro
Support for Steelseries Apex M800 macro keys on linux, tested on Debian Jessie.

Originally circles keys on my Apex M800 keyboard were sending same keycodes as the multimedia keys.
These files remap circle keys 0 to 5 scancodes to unused keycodes : F13 to F18.

You can then create custom shortcuts for circle 0-5 keys to achieve macros (for example with xdotool).
